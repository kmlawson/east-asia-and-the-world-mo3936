# Marking

Within the School of History all work is assessed on a scale of 1-20 with intervals of 0.5. Module outcomes are reported using the same scale but with intervals of 0.1. The assessment criteria set out below are not comprehensive, but are intended to provide guidance in interpreting grades and improving the quality of assessed work. Students should bear in mind that presentation is an important element of assessment and that failure to adhere to the guidelines set out in the School of History Style Sheet will be penalised.

Again, you can find the style sheet here:

**Outstanding First**: 19.0, 19.5, 20.0  
**Clear First**: 18.0, 18.5  
**Borderline First**: 16.5, 17.0, 17.5  
First Class work will be distinguished in some or all of the following ways: originality of thought or interpretation; independence of judgement; wide-ranging reading, often beyond that recommended; intelligent use of primary sources; historiographical awareness and criticism; clarity and rigour of argument and structure, well directed at the title; clarity and elegance of style; unusual and apt examples; comparison e.g. with themes and topics covered in other modules.  

**Upper Second Class** 13.5, 14.0, 14.5, 15.0, 15.5, 16.0   
Upper Second Class work will be distinguished in some or all of the following ways: clarity and rigour of argument and structure, well directed at the title; thorough coverage of recommended reading; intelligent use of primary sources; historiographical awareness; well chosen examples; comparison e.g. with themes and topics covered in other modules; clarity of style.  

**Lower Second Class**: 10.5, 11.0, 11.5, 12.0, 12.5, 13.0    
Lower Second Class work will have some of the following features: some evidence of knowledge and understanding, but limitations in clarity and rigour of argument and structure; restricted coverage of recommended reading; restricted use of primary sources; weaknesses of style; failure to address the title set.  

**Third Class**: 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0  
Third Class work will have some of the following features: very limited knowledge and understanding; confusion in argument or structure; insufficient reading; confused style; failure to address the title set.  

**Pass**: 7.0  

**Fail (with the right to re-assessment)**: 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5  
Work with very serious deficiencies that falls below the required standard, failing to address the literature with the seriousness required and with an inadequate grasp of the subject matter and of historical analysis.   

**Fail (without the right to re-assessment)**: 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5   
Work so weak as to indicate that only a nominal attempt has been made to complete the assignment, or that it displays virtually total confusion and misunderstanding of the subject.  

**Unclassifiable**: 0  
No acceptable work presented.   

**Re-marking of assessed work**

Students have only limited grounds on which to launch appeals. The University’s policy is as follows. “Challenges should be submitted on the specific grounds of: procedural irregularity; bias or prejudice; exceptional personal circumstances not previously notified for good reason; harassment or bullying affecting academic performance by a member of staff involved in granting the marks, grades or classification concerned.” A formal challenge should be lodged in writing (email is acceptable) within 5 days of the original mark being notified to the student.

If a student wishes to appeal a coursework mark, they should therefore formally notify the course coordinator (or if the coordinator happens also to be the tutor who has given the disputed mark, then they should notify the Director of Teaching. The course coordinator will then institute a review as follows: the grounds for the complaint will be examined, and if the course coordinator believes the appeal should be upheld then the work will be referred to a second tutor teaching on the course, nominated by the course coordinator. The work will then be re-marked, and any discrepancy dealt with by the normal process of discussion and moderation. The course coordinator will act as moderator in case of disagreement. The work concerned will be marked blind (that is, referred to the member of staff offering the second opinion without them being aware of the mark originally given). The student will be informed of the decision within 5 working days of the course coordinator receiving the formal appeal.

If at the end of this process the student is still not satisfied s/he should submit an appeal in writing to the Senate Office within one calendar month after the outcome has been received from the School.
