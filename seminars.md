### Week 1	Introductions: East Asia and the Global Context

**Online Task:** Visit the map collection and searchable database here: http://rumsey.mapranksearch.com/
In the map section on the centre of the page, zoom and pan the map to cover East Asia. Below the map, set the search terms to 1845-1955 and, as you do so, a list of maps will appear to the right. Browse the maps, and choose 2 of them that you find interesting of East Asia or some part of East Asia during our time period. When you click on the map you will be taken to a detailed view of it. At the top of the screen is a link to "Share This" which, when you click on it, will make an internet link appear. Please copy down and email me this link for the two maps you have chosen and we will have a look at them and discuss them in class.
